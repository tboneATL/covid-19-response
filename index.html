											<h1>What We're Doing.</h1>
											<p>Making Face Shields. Not organizing or recruiting.  Not selling or marketing anything. Just sharing in the interest of saving others time.</p>
										</header>
										<p>We are a just family with a couple of 3d printers and a laser cutter that is trying to help. We are not trying to recruit or organize others. We have learned a lot and want to share in
											case it can help others who might be looking to do the same thing in their community.
											We started printing shields on Friday, Mar 27 and have produced several hundred since then.



										<p>We did not create this idea or the original designs, but have made some changes to help us make more of them.</p>

										<p>There is a huge community working on this, including the Facebook group called "Open Source COVID19 Medical Supplies".  Designs and ideas opinions and data are constantly evolving ...there may be better solutions out there. We are working directly with practicioners on the front
											lines at 4 hospitals that have tested the product and asked us to produce more.

										<h2>What design we're using and why.</h2>
									</header>
									<div>
										<h4>Note that there is some controversy in the community around a design like this that has open space between the forehead and the shield vs one that is completely closed.  We agree that it would be ideal
											to not have a gap but that adds significant time to printing (which means fewer shields).  We did a small batch and have been told by people on the front lines that the gap is not an issue.  This feedback
											is based on over 200 delivered as we write this.
											You should check with your designated recipient(s) to make sure they are ok with whatever design you choose to make.
										</h4>

										<p>We are using a design based on the Verkstan (aka Swedish) frame design.  Here's how we came to that decision:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Started with Prusa, very long to print. Requires elastic.</li>
											<li>Saw video (below) from 3d Printing Nerd.  It was the first I saw with feedback from someone on the front lines. Feedback was very positive (watch the video)</li>
											<li>Verkstan design is thinner design, less material which translates to more shields in less time. Press fit, no elastic required, but it can be added for a tighter fit</li>
											<li>As we worked to optimize the production, we began to used stacked versions of the print.  This caused some minor problems with quality,
												so we've iterated now through 4 <a href="shield-designs-for-3d-printing">designs</a>.  </li>
										</ul>
										<h4>We're open to better designs and may change again.  If you are following along and printing, we encourage you to frequently check <a href="">resources</a> in the various shield making communities
										and/or keep an eye on our <a href="">current print</a></h4>

										<h2>What materials we're using.</h2>

									<div>
										<h4>Note that there is some controversy in the maker community around material choice.  Most are saying that PETG >> PLA >> ABS is the order of preference.

										</h4>
										<p>Some information about the materials we're using.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>We're using a mix of PETG and PLA due to material we can get and printers we have.</li>
												<li>PETG (Inland brand). We cannot find any MSDS for this product.  PETG has a melting point of 225 degrees Celsius.</li>
												<li>PLA (Inland brand). We cannot find any MSDS for this product.  PLA has a melting point of 170 degrees Celsius.</li>

										<h2>What process we're using for the shields we're making.</h2>
									</header>
									<div>
										<h4>We are producing these in our kitchen, not a sterile manufacturing environment.  No one in our household is symptomatic or has any reason to believe we've been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
											  We encourage anyone receiving these shields to take their own steps to disinfect and use their own safety practices. We encourage anyone making these shields to discuss your
											  process with your recipient(s).
										</h4>
										<ol>
											<li>We print the frames in batches</li>
											<li>The holes for the shields are cut using a 50W CO2 laser cutter</li>
											<li>We disinfect frames in an Isopropyl alcohol bath right before packing them into Ziploc brand freezer bags in batches of 10-15, using gloves.</li>
											<li>Shields (sheets) are wiped down with alcohol on both sides and are batched in a single Ziploc freezer bag to be delivered with the frames.</li>
											<li>We arrange for delivery, either personally driving them directly to our recipients or arranging someone to pick them up from our front step.</li>
											<li>We are not handing them off...instead, using a sort of "dead drop"</li>

										<h2>Frequently asked questions.</h2>
									</header>
									<h4>Below are common questions we've received and our repsonses.</h4>
									<p class="question">
										<b> Q:</b> How much do these cost?
									</p>
									<p class="answer">
										<b>A:</b> We are not charging for these shields.  We are donating them.  They are not very expensive to make, but do take a long time to produce each one. 1kg plastic spool yields at least 100
										frames and costs $20-$30 per spool.  The transparency sheets cost around $30 for 100.  So, rough math says they are about $.50 each to make, not counting labor and other things that are part of the process (electricity,
										isopropyl alcohol, and, of course, the 3d printers and laser cutting equipment)
									</p>
									<p class="question">
										Q: How long do they take to make?
									</p>
									<p class="answer">
										A: Printing the frames for the design we've been using takes 30-55 mins depending on settings.  Right now our most optimized approach is to stack them in batches of 20 and run 2 printers at the same time.  We're getting about
										80-90 frames per 24 hours right now, just in our household.  We're looking into options for laser cutting frames to either compliment or supplant the 3d printing process, depending on results.
