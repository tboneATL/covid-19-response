                                    Tatiana picked up another 90 kits to deliver to THS ER - we think this will hold them for a few days.  We've produced over 300 now.
                                </p>
                                <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28732130/78334121-303c0380-7559-11ea-8bd6-564f450bf4d2.png" />

                                    Printed about 80 or so frames.  New Caskey design improved some cosmetics but can be tough to pull apart when stacked.  We are not having trouble with PLA off the Rostock, the the PETG from the MK2 is
                                    really tricky.  We used a kitchen knife on a cutting board and gently hammered it down with Cris' trusty pestle from Puerto Rico.  Once you can get the knife started, it's not too bad to follow the ridge and
                                    gently break them apart.

                                    I've had the McMaster-Carr box sitting there w/ PETG sheet but haven't had any time to experiment on the laser.. I think tomorrow is the day for that.  Can't believe it's Friday.

                                <p>Optimized even more the process and design.. Basically both printers running stacks of 20 each in about 10 hours, so roughly 80-90 per day. Quality is good overall , but the PETG stacking isn't as clean as the PLA and takes more post-processing.
                                <br/><br/>Ryan Caskey has been iterating on another design - letting it run overnight to see how it does. I think it will be a winner though (Caskey-Remix)</p>

                                <p>Printed 60-70 by optimizing speed and changing the <a href="">design</a>. Full day at work, but Elena and I worked on a simple <a href="">web page</a> to help others find info about printing these.

                                <br/><br/>Dr Martin, Ryan Caskey, Anthony Aragues are also printing away. Still good feedback from intial deliveries from Saturday and Monday.

                                <br/><br/>Breakthrough on the design file. Andrea Zaccanigno modified the file to help us print better stacks (Thank you!). This is making a huge difference in that we can just let the printer run. Hoping to deliver 100+ tomorrow.

                                <br/><br/>Received PETG sheets today for the laser, but didnt have time to pull them out of the box. Hopefully tomorrow.

                                <br/><br/>As a side note, I'm loving all the time working with Elena on this stuff. I'm having fun learning a lot more about the product I sell (GitHub) as Elena and I have been collaborating on getting this page stood up.</p>

                                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> These are sticking together more than the other design. Not sure why that is, but it's a challenge to pull them apart without breaking them... lost 3 or 4 learning that lesson. More detail <a href="https://github.com/tboneATL/covid-19-response/issues/1#issuecomment-606384990">here</a>.

                                <br/><br/>Really need to figure this out. A clean, stackable print will help this scale. Printing 2UP all day since we have a house full of people that can swap the prints when it's time.

                                <br/><br/>Our friend Tatiana picks up 60 today. 30 for her hospital and 30 for another ER in a nearby town. She agrees to get some feedback.

                                <br/><br/>A few hours later. she shares this with me:</p>
                                <img class="image" src="media/30mar2.png" alt="">

                                <p>I'm not looking for money, but it's nice to know these are helpful. It's also a bit daunting. It's now even more clear that we need to scale up. How to scale?</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Optimize prints: This will only help slightly</li>
                                    <li>Find a different process to compliment the current one. If we can cut these from flat sheets vs 3D printing them then we could produce a lot more. I ordered some PETG sheets from McMaster on Saturday. Scheduled to arrive Tuesday or Wed.</li>
                                    <li>Add more printers by getting more people involved. That has it's own set of challenges with respect to coordination.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I discuss with Cris and Elena - Elena is going to put together some basic web pages to share info for people with printers. We're wanting to share and inform so others can act locally. We're not wanting to organize and administrate a group.

                                <br/><br/>Cris will take more of a project management role and help coordinate, keep printers moving, etc.

                                <br/><br/>Anthony Aragues shared this <a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/world">map</a> that shows (known) Prusa brand 3d printers in our area. There are countless other brands: </p>

                                <p>If you have a 3d printer or know someone that does, point them here. If they are experienced with 3d printing, then the info we've assembled so far should help get them started. I am working on a 'Getting started' guide that might help someone that is not as experienced with it.</p>

                            <p>Printers ran all night. Not sure how many we have in the morning - probably a couple of dozen. Kept running all day. Anthony dropped off a batch of 10 or so.

                            <br/><br/><strong>Finished the day with nearly 70 frames!</strong>

                            <br/><br/>The big win today was getting the laser more dialed in. My wife Cris learned to operate it and knocked out 50 sheets in a fraction of the time as the 3-hole punch and with more accuracy.

                            <br/><br/>Lightburn software is so much better than the stuff that came with the laser.

                            <br/><br/>Others have been asking me for info on how to get going, where to get the models, etc. I set up this repo to try and keep things organized for myself and others looking to do the same thing.

                            <br/><br/>It would be way better if we could reliably stack these things and let the printer do all the work vs printing them 1 or 2 at a time and having to babysit to change prints every 1.5 hours or so. However, stacking the Verkstan design has some challenges because of things I won't go into here, but the brow sometimes fails to print solid when stacked. In these cases, the frame is fully intact and functional, but the brow fill might have holes.

                            <br/><br/>I delivered the first batch with some of these with an explanation that it was better for the staff to determine if they could be used or should be discarded.

                            <br/><br/>The feedback I got was that it would be nice, but it's not critical, at least for the nurses I'm supporting, although that could change.

                            <br/><br/><strong>Open or closed?</strong>

                            <br/><br/>There has been a bit of confusion and mixed feedback in the forums over whether the top of the shield can be open or not. I think most people would agree that the more closed off it can be, the better, but there is a tradeoff with speed to produce. This seems to be a pretty hot topic, still.

                            <br/><br/>The Prusa design is very popular but has been rejected by many because it's open. Many are turning to the Verkstan design because it is more closed (but it still has gaps). There are many other designs.

                            <br/><br/>Yesterday I learned the Prusa design it has been approved by Michigan Medicine Procurement. So open-top design might not be a show stopper.

                            <br/><br/>IF it's ok for them to be open, then it would be better (faster and more stackable) to change the design slightly to remove the solid brow piece as shown below.
                            </p>

                            <p>My friend Andrea is a CAD expert so I asked him to make a mod to the STL I've been using to possibly make it faster to print, but really I'm looking for a design that is better suited to stacking.

                            <br/><br/>Elena figured out how to get them to stack in the model and the first batch of the remix is printing now. So far, so good!</p>

                            <p>Still lots to do, but we have 38 units ready to pack and deliver. I'm anxious to get feedback from Edgar and team to make sure we're not heading in the wrong direction by printing a design that doesn't work for them. Some friends are also printing this design.

                            <br/><br/>Need to disinfect as best we can before delivering them. Also I need to write a detailed <a href="https://github.com/tboneATL/covid-19-response/blob/master/Documents/Important-info-for-face-shields.md">note</a> that explains the materials, process, and some general disclaimers that we are not pros.

                            <br/><br/>I drop them off with my buddy Edgar. We did a sort of dead drop in front of the hospital, he was gowned and masked up.</p>
                            <img class="image" src="media/28mar1.png" alt="">

                            <p>A few hours later, he shares some photos and a video saying that these are helpful. That's encouraging. We talk for a while about possibly reusing the frames and refilling the plastic sheets later (much faster to make those). We talk about the design a bit - the shield was too low for many. He says they were easy enough to cut with scissors. He mentions some of the doctors suggested foam would be nice to add for comfort. This surprises me because there has been so much talk of non-porous materials in the FB group.</p>
                            <img class="image" src="media/28mar2.png" alt="">
                            <p>He said the frame fits him just fine with pressure, but some of the female nurses found it a bit loose. Elastic seemed to fix it.

                            <br/><br/>I ask if we could move the holes lower on the sheet - this would offer more protection up high and also raise the bottom. I can't do this with the 3 hole punch, but I have a laser cutter that I've not used much in the last couple of years. Hope it still works.

                            <br/><br/>Already printing the next batch. Elena and I work on getting the laser tuned in so we can cut the sheets on it.

                            <br/><br/>I get a request to deliver 60 for 2 ERs by Monday. If we can get the laser running, it opens up possibilies of producing more using a different design/process. This one looks promising. It uses flexible flat sheet for the headband and an elastic strap:</p>

                            <br/><br/>More printing. My daughter <a href="https://elenathornton.github.io">Elena</a> is 19 and has complained about how bored she's been these past 2 weeks (extended Spring Break - COVID-cation she sarcastically called it). She's studying CS and is capable. I put her on print duty. Later that evening we have some working prototypes.</p>

                            <p>I pull out my old delta-style printer from the basement. Task Elena with making it move. She does.

                            <br/><br/>We print all night and have about 20 by 3am. I find a file out there that stacks them up so you don't have to wake up every hour to change the print. Brilliant!</p>

                                <p>Microcenter's website says PETG in stock at my store. Will store be open? Are they an essential business? Walmart has some elastic in stock. Purchased it for in-store pickup. Office Depot has transparency film in stock. Will they be open?

                                <br/><br/>My wife agreed to get involved with this as I have a lot of things going on at work today - very important meeting at 330p and lots going on before that. If she can get materials, we can set the printer to run in the background, shouldn't be that hard.

                                <br/><br/>I also talked with Dr Martin this morning - Science teacher from our kids' school. She's already been experimenting with some masks and visors.

                                <br/><br/>She has access to printers and transparency film. We have a lot of questions:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We know we can make the shields, but will they be useful?</li>
                                    <li>Are they safe? What materials can we use?</li>
                                    <li>If we build them, will they use them?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Power outage in our neighborhood. Horrible timing. I have a full house of "coworkers" and I need to WFH. My wife leaves the house around 10:30a to get the goods. Comes back an hour later - that was easy. Power Co saying ETR is 245p.</p>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHDMdyN5Jjs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                                <p>Johnny from Ultimachine happened to call me. He turned me onto a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHDMdyN5Jjs">video</a> that showed a different design from Sweden, that didn't require elastic and seemed to use less material. MORE importantly, it featured a nurse that gave a review of it after using it for a full shift. That was what I was waiting to hear.
                                <br/><br/>Still. No. Power.
                                <br/><br/>Turns out a tree took out a powerline last night but to fix it they have to kill the entire block. 2:45p ETR turns into 5pm ETR> turns into 7p turns into 9p then 10p. Finally! lights back on.
                                <br/><br/>Now I can try to print.
                                <br/><br/>PETG is very different than PLA! Wrestle with some settings and get a basic frame done. Took forever, found another design that seems smaller and faster to produce. Things in the open source group are getting intersesting as bickering and re-invention abounds.
                                <br/><br/>I put a call out on Facebook to see if some friends that work in various capacities in medicine. One Dr says, "We're good". Another nurse says "We're good for now". A friend who was an EMT but now trauma center nurse says "YES". We get on a call and he answers a ton of my questions.
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>He tells me they were using goggles from Home Depot because they couldn't get face shields.</blockquote>
                                <p>Shit just got real. We make arrangements for produce as many as possible and meet him tomorrow during his shift to drop them off.</p>

                                Lots of activity in that FB group, many focusing on printing masks. Some trying to build DIY ventilators. I'm still skeptical about the masks though. Long prints and lack of knowledge of the filter material scare me.
                                Not going there.
